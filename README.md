# RPGfree-to-Excel
very basic brute force write .xml document from rpg for multi-tab excel documents

use of rpgfree service programs to create .xml file for import into multi-tab worksheets.

some of it is ugly...its not elegant, but there's enough here to start you on your own project.

so...what do we have and what do you need?

1)  the service programs themselves

2)  a small and stupid example

3)  a small example that we actually use daily
