There are three pieces to a service program

1)  The procedures themselves in the appropriate source member in this
    source file: STSSRC/Service.  (Example: STSSRC/Service,Dates)

2)  The procedure headers or prototypes in
    the same member name with an Hprefix.
    (Example: STSSRC/Service, HDates)

3)  The binding directives in
    the same member name with an Bprefix.
    (Example: STSSRC/Service, BDates)

To add a new procedure -> ALWAYS ADD TO THE BOTTOM OF THE LIST!!!

1)  Put the procedure header in the header source member
2)  Put the procedure in the procedure source member
3)  Add the binding directives in the binder source member
4)  CRTRPGMOD from the procedure source member
      NOTE:  if the procedure source member is an SQLRPGLE type,
             use CRTSQLRPGI OBJTYPE(*MODULE)
5)  CRTSRVPGM from the procedure source member.  Remember to use
    EXPORT(*SRCFILE) SRCFILE(STSSRC/Service) SRCMBR(Bxxxxxx)
     where Bxxxxxx is the binder member name.

NOTE:  if changing (adding) to the binder source member, be sure to
       code what WAS there as *CURRENT and *PRV and to make a new
       *CURRENT section that includes the procedure you're adding.

NOTE:  don't forget to put EXPORT on the procedure...duh...

NOTE:  ALWAYS write the test programs first.
       put the service programs in, and have them return nothing,
       then compile and create the service programs.
       that way they're functional, but don't return any data

NOTE:  For a brand new service program:
       if you want people to be able to take advantage of the service
       program without having to explicitly add it to the compile, it must
       be added to the binding directory in STSOBJ.  The binding directory
       is SERVICE and xxxx is your service program name.
                ADDBNDDIRE BNDDIR(STSOBJ/SERVICE) OBJ((xxxx))
       Validate that it's in, by:
                DSPBNDDIR BNDDIR(STSOBJ/SERVICE)
       Now, to take advantage of your new service program (or any service
       program, without having to mess with it during compile, the H spec
               H  BNDDIR ('STSOBJ/SERVICE')
       is simply put at the top of the program source code
